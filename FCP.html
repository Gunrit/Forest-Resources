        <p>Embark on a journey through our diverse range of initiatives that aim to preserve the beauty and functionality of our forests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Selective harvesting:</strong> Removing only mature, overcrowded, diseased, dying, or poorly formed trees.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable forest management:</strong> Managing forests in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable harvesting:</strong> Providing a constant supply of wood resources throughout the landscape, with future timber yields unaffected or improved by current harvesting methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Verifying responsible harvest:</strong> Establishing management plans that enable rebuilding within a specified time frame if stock sizes are below management target levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Harvesting assessments:</strong>Providing feedback about the quality of forest harvesting operations.
            </li>
